# Quora_question_pair_pridiction
Quora is an online question answer forum where questions are asked,answered,followed and edited by internet users.It is a place to gain and share knowledge. Over 100 million people visit Quora every month, so it's no surprise that many people ask similarly worded questions. Multiple questions with the same intent can cause seekers to spend more time finding the best answer to their question, and make writers feel they need to answer multiple versions of the same question. Quora values canonical questions because they provide a better experience to active seekers and writers, and offer more value to both of these groups in the long term.  Problem Goal:-  Identifying the duplicate question that have already been asked. Predict wheather a pair of questions are duplicates or not. This will help in prividing the answers to the question that have already been answered.
